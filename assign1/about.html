	<ul>
		<li>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the
			site that we should know about?</li>
		<p>I used External Style Sheet, Internal Style Sheet and Inline Styles
			to insert CSS. Moreover, I used the implode() function to return a
			string from the elements of the Permission Type array so that user's
			permission type can be stored easily in the database table. And
			besides, I attempted to use object oriented programming method to
			deal with some tasks, but I found it is easier to use procedual
			method to deal with the tasks because the tasks are very
			straightforward and simple, so I use procedual method instead of OOP
			at last.</p>

		<li>Which parts did you have trouble with?</li>
		<p>I was stuck in checking if the status table exists in the database,
			and I found some solutions. Finally, I used the function
			mysqli_num_rows($result) and SQL query "SHOW TABLES LIKE status" to
			solve the problem.</p>

		<li>What would you like to do better next time?</li>
		<p>I would like to use Bootstrap framework for faster and easier web
			development next time.</p>

		<li>What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to
			create your website?</li>
		<p>I mainly used w3schools.com as references when I was stuck in some
			pronlem. It is a really great website for beginners so that I can
			find most of solutions on it.</p>

		<li>What you have learnt along the way?</li>
		<p>I have learnt how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP to build
			website. I also learnt how to to insert form to catch user's inputs.
			And I have a deep insightt in regular expressions to check user's
			inputs. Furthermore, I understood how to connect to and manipulate
			databases with PHP.</p>
